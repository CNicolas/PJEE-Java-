# PJEE-Java-
PJEE : Project JEE (for ETNA school)

This project is a free project for my school. The setpoint was to create a full web site in Java/JEE, using recent technologies.

For this project, I used :

- Java 1.8
- SpringBoot 1.2.5.RELEASE (Based on SpringFramework 4)
- Tomcat embedded
This way, you don't need a jboss server to deploy your app !
- Gradle (Building app.war, dependencies...)
- Thymeleaf (Templating)
- Bootstrap 3 (CSS)

Two UML diagrams are joined.
